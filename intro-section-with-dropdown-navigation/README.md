### What I learned

In this project, I learned and implemented several key aspects to enhance user experience and responsiveness on different devices:

1. **Dropdown Navigation for Desktop and Mobile**:
   - Created a responsive navigation menu that includes dropdowns for both desktop and mobile views.
   - Implemented interactive functionality to display dropdown menus upon clicking/tapping on navigation links (Features, Company).
2. **Optimal Layout for Different Screen Sizes**:
   - Ensured the content layout adapts to various screen sizes using media queries.
   - Adjusted the navigation layout and content positioning for both desktop (min-width: 768px) and mobile views.
3. **Hover States for Interactive Elements**:
   - Applied hover states for interactive elements like navigation links and buttons to enhance user feedback and visual interactivity.
4. **HTML Structure**:
   - Utilized semantic HTML elements to organize content efficiently and enhance accessibility.
5. **CSS Styling**:
   - Styled the navigation menu, dropdowns, buttons, and content sections using CSS to achieve a visually appealing and responsive design.
6. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Implemented JavaScript event listeners to handle dropdown visibility for the Features and Company navigation items.
   - Utilized JavaScript to manage the off-canvas menu functionality, toggling its visibility on mobile devices and ensuring proper interaction.
7. **Overlay Functionality**:
   - Created an overlay to cover the content when the off-canvas menu is active on mobile devices, providing a clearer focus on the menu.
8. **Event Handling:**
   - Event listeners were added to the dropdown buttons and toggle button, enabling the opening and closing of the dropdown menus and off-canvas navigation on user clicks.
9. **Media Queries and Responsive Design**:
   - Used media queries to adjust the layout, positioning, and styling of elements to provide an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
10. **Accessibility and User Interaction**:
    - Enhanced user interaction by making the navigation elements accessible and easy to use on different devices.

This project allowed me to gain practical experience in building a responsive and interactive navigation system, handling dropdowns, and ensuring a seamless user experience across various screen sizes and devices.
